# Excel-to-X in Go

Built by Jared Hettinger

Excel-to-X in Go is a tutorial and example for how to create Go programs that will parse an Excel file (XLSX, CSV, or TSV) and use the contents to get 'X' done. Whether it's downloading files, trying to do a bulk upload, or automating something else, this project will be a great place to get started.

This project is based on [Excel-to-X](https://github.com/kafkaesc/Excel-to-X), a project written in JavaScript using Node.
